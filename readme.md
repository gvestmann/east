# EAST - React native app dedicated to the beauty of the east's mountains

This is a simple image app that links you to info on mountains in the Eastfjords. The styling is quite simple and it contains four different mountains - but the app is built in a way you could add the thousands of them.  

You could either view it locally with Expo, or on Expo GO for Android and iOS with my Heroku hosted app.

###### Expo locally
To use Expo, you'll need:
* Node.js LTS
* Git
* Watchman **(if you're using macOS)**

To install Expo locally, if you haven't done it yet: 
`npm install --global expo-cli`

To start up Expo on your computers, you run:
`npm start`

###### Expo on the phone
You'll find the Expo Go app on your AppStore and Google Play.

Scan the barcode and view those mountains in all their glory!
