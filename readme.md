# EAST - React native app dedicated to the beauty of the east's mountains
This is a simple image app that links you to info on mountains in the Eastfjords. The styling is quite simple and it contains four different mountains - but the app is built in a way you could add all the thousands of them.  

###### Expo on iOS
For view the app on iOS, you'l install it locally.

Download the git repo to you computer.

To use Expo, you'll need:
* Node.js LTS
* Git
* [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) **(if you're using macOS)**

To install Expo locally, if you haven't done it yet: 
`npm install --global expo-cli`

To start up Expo on your computers, you run:
`npm start`

You'll also have to signup for an Expo account and login into it, both in ExpoCLI Expo GO. That way you can view the app on iPhone with Expo GO from the AppStore. Once you have the project running on your computer, it should popup in the Expo GO app.

You could also technically view it in the browser, but it won't look quite the same as on phone. 

If you're using macOS, you have the possibility to view it via iPhone emulator. If you haven't got that installed, I recommend skipping it, because it's quite a hassle.

**Signup**
Head to [Expo.io/signup](https://expo.io/signup) and create an account.

**Login**
From the projects' terminal: 
```
-u, --username [your-username]
-p, --password [your-password]
```

###### Expo on Android
Using Expo on Android is quite simpler. All you need is to install the [Expo GO app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US) from Google Play and scan my [barcode](https://expo.io/@gvestmann/projects/east). You will need to signup/login though.
